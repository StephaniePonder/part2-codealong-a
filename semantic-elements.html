    <h1>My favorite superheroes: A semantic webpage</h1>
    <h2>DC superheroes</h2>
      <p><em>DC superhero comics are the best.</em> <br>
        The storylines are more complex and often address real life social issues. <u>My favorite is <strong>Aquaman</strong></u>.</p>
    <h3>Marvel superheroes or whatever</h3>
      <p><q>Marvel superhero comics feel more two dimensional.</q> <small>However, Marvel Comics is really killing it in the film
      and TV idustries, whereas DC's attempts to capitalize on TV and film are more mediocre.</small></p>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>To summarize, Marvel superheroes are not as cool as DC heroes. But they do have decent movies and TV shows</p>
           <blockquote>for whatever that's worth.</blockquote>
